## Organize repositories with Organizations 

The best way to organize repositories is to create *organizations*. We can then use these as folders to store repos. 

- Click the account icon and choose *Your organizations*. 
- Click *new organization*. 

Now we can transfer ownership of a repo into our new organization: 

- Open a repository. 
- Click settings. 
- Scroll all the down to the **Danger Zone**. 
- Choose *transfer ownership*.
